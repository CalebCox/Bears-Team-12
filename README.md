* Assign yourself to a task and move card to `In-Development` column.
* When work is complete and you made a PR move card to `To-Review` column.
* After the PR approved and the branch was merged to `Development`, move the card to the `Done` column. Make sure all the subtasks in the checklist are checked.

**GitHub Flow:**

* `Development` branch is the default branch.
* For each functionality/task - work on a separate branch.
* The branch would be merged to `Development` by one of the other team members.
* At the end of each sprint we will merge `Development` to `Master`.
